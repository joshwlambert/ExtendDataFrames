Foundational data structures allow manipulation data minimal effort cognitive load. One commonly required data structures tabular data. can represented R ways, example matrix data frame. data frame (class data.frame) flexible tabular data structure, can hold different data types (e.g. numbers, character strings, etc.) across different columns. contrast matrices – arrays dimensions – thus can hold single data type. Data frames can even nested, cells can data frames lists. therefore clear data frames prevalent. However, without limitations. relatively basic printing method can fload R console number columns rows large. useful methods (e.g., summary() str()), might appropriate certain types tabular data. cases useful utilise R’s inheritance mechanisms (specifically S3 inheritance) write extensions R’s data.frame class. case data frame superclass new subclass extends inherits methods (see Adv R1 details S3 inheritance).
